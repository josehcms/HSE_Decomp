## Decomposition

$$\textcolor{violet}{\mathbb{Z}} = \textcolor{red}{f}(\textcolor{blue}{\theta})$$

\pause
Example
$$\textcolor{red}{f}() = \int _0^\omega e^{-\int _o^x \mu(t) \mathrm{d}t} \mathrm{d}x$$

\pause
$$\textcolor{blue}{\theta} = [\mu]$$

\pause
$$ \textcolor{violet}{\mathbb{Z}} = e(0) $$

## Decomposition

Say we have a difference between two outcomes:

$$\zeta = \mathbb{Z '} - \mathbb{Z} = f(\theta ') - f(\theta)$$
\pause

It's due to differences in input parameters, $\theta$

\pause

Property
$$ \zeta = \sum \kappa_i$$

\pause
$\kappa_i$ is the $i^{th}$ ``contribution'' to $\zeta$, attributable to differences between $\theta_i$ and $\theta '_i$.

$\kappa$ is on the scale of $\mathbb{Z}$

## Motivation

\begin{exampleblock}{}
  {\large ``I believe [decomposition] is the key idea of all the methods founded in the core of demography. Decomposition theory is based on the simple principle of separating demographic measures into components that contribute to an understanding of the phenomena under study''}

## More examples

>- How much of a life expecancy gap is due to differences in young vs old mortality? 
>- Which ages and causes account for differences in lifespan variation?
>- How much of overall variation is due to variation within subgroups versus variation between subgroups?
>- Which ages and parities account for differences in TFR?
>- How much of a crude rate is due to differences is rates vs population structure?
>- How much of an increase in disabled life expectancy is due to short vs long bouts of disability?

## Motivation

>- Understanding
>- Targetting interventions

## Summary

>- if you can calculate it you can decompose it
>- enrich measurement, monitoring, science, even activism
